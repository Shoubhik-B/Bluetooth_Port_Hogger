# Bluetooth_Port_Hogger
Seeks to connect to Bluetooth peripherals, keeping the port activated. Especially useful for devices like HM-10 Bluetooth modules which tend to get disconnected the moment nothing is looking for it, being a nightmare to reconnect. We can thus use a Python based server which always keeps the port active and relays signals for other applications.
